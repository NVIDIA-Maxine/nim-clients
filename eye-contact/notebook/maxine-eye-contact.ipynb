        "\n",
        "- `temporal` - (UINT32) Flag to control temporal filtering (default `0xffffffff`). When set to true, the landmark computation for eye contact is temporally optimized.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `detect_closure` - (UINT32) Flag to toggle detection of eye closure and occlusion. If turned off, blink and occlusion detection turns off. This might be desirable during estimation-only mode if you still want to obtain gaze estimation in case of occlusion. Not recommended for gaze redirection. Value is either 0 or 1 (default 0).\n",
        "\n",
        "- `eye_size_sensitivity` - (UINT32) Eye size sensitivity parameter that modifies the blending parameters to use a larger region around the eyes for blending. Integer value from 2 to 6 (default 3).\n",

        "### Randomized Look Away Parameters\n",
        "\n",
        "A continuous redirection of gaze to look at the camera might give a perception of staring. Some users might find this effect unnatural or undesired. To occasionally break eye contact, you can enable randomized look away in gaze redirection. Although the gaze is always expected to redirect toward the camera within the range of operation, enabling look away makes the user occasionally break gaze lock to the camera with a micro-movement of the eyes at randomly chosen time intervals. The `enable_look_away` parameter must be set to true to enable this feature. Additionally, you can use the optional parameters `look_away_offset_max`, `look_away_interval_min`, and `look_away_interval_range` to tune the extent and frequency of look away.\n",

        "\n",
        "- `lookaway_max_offset` - (UINT32) Maximum value of gaze offset angle (degrees) during a random look away when look away is enabled. Requires `--enable_look_away` parameter to be set to true. Integer value from 1 to 10 (default 5).\n",
        "\n",
        "- `lookaway_interval_min` - (UINT32) Minimum limit for the number of frames at which random look away occurs when look away is enabled. Requires `--enable_look_away` parameter to be set to true. Integer value from 1 to 600 (default 3).\n",
        "\n",
